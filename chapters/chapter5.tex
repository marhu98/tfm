\chapter{Statistical Inference Using the
Morse-Smale Complex}

It is natural to think that be could treat the problem
of aproximating the homology of a manifold from a finite 
sample from a stastical point of view. 
That is what we will try to do in this chapter. It will be based on the findings of the paper: \cite{che2017}.

The main idea is to use the decomposition given in \ref{handle}.

As in the previous sections we assume we have a d-manifold $M^d\subset \mathbb{R}^n$
and we have a Morse function on it $f:M^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
