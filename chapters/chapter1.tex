\begin{definition}[Differential complex]
We say that a collection of indexed abelian groups
$\{C_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ is a differential complex if
it has a linear operator:
$\delta_i: C_{i+1}\to C_i$
so that $\delta_i\circ\delta_{i+1}=0$.

Usually, we shall consider $\delta: C\to C$ where $C=\oplus C_i$
and $\delta$ is defined as the unique linear operator that coincides with $\delta_i$
when the domain is restricted to $C_i$.

And so, we may write that $\{C_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ 
is a differential complex if and only if $\delta^2=0$.
\end{definition}

Given a manifold we can build a nice function on it, $f$,
so that it's sublevels $M^t=f^{-1}(-\infty,t]$ give us a natural way to 
deduce a CW-structure for the manifold.

In fact, these same function give us in a natural way the Morse-Smale complex,
which allows us to compute the homology of the manifold.

\begin{definition}[Morse function]

Let $M$ be a manifold, and $f\in C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R})$.
We say that $f$ is a morse function if the set of critical points
of $f$ is isolated. 

That is, if:
$
Crit(f)=\{x\in M: df\vert_x=0
\}
$
is isolated.

\end{definition}

We say that a critical point of $f$ has index $k$,
if the hessian of $f$ has index $k$ at the critical point.

We denote the critical points of index $k$ as $Crit_k(f)$.

It is well known that for any given manifold there are plenty of Morse functions,
in particular we have the following:


\begin{theorem}
\cite{mat1997}
Let $g\in C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R})$, and let $\epsilon>0$
then there exists $f\in C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R})$ so that $f$
is a Morse function and $f$ and $g$ are $C^2$-close.
\end{theorem}

So Morse functions are dense in the ring $C^\infty(M,\mathbb{R})$,
and a fortiori, Morse functions always exits.

Morse functions give quite a bit of topological information on the manifold,
specially in the compact case. 



One important source of complexes is the Morse-Smale complex,
which arises in a natural way.


\section{Fundamental theorems of Morse theory}

\begin{theorem}[Morse lemma]
\cite{mat1997}
Let $M^n$ be a manifold, and $f$ a Morse function on $M$.
Let $x_0$ be critical point of $f$ of index $k$.


Then there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $x_0$ and a chart 
$y:U\to V\subset M$. so that:

$$
f\circ y (y_1,\ldots,y_n)
=
-y_1^2
-\cdots
-y_k^2
+y_{k+1}^2
+\cdots
+y_n^2
+C
$$

Where $C$ is a constant.
\end{theorem}

Let $f$ be a Morse function on $M$,
We notice that in the compact case $f$ has 
a minimum, $m$ and a maximum $M$
achieved at points $x_m$ and $x_M$.

Then $M^{x_m}=\emptyset$ and $M^{x_M}=M$.
This hints that we can restruct $M$ from how the sets $M^t$
change as $t$ moves through the real line.

In particular, fix some $\varepsilon$ which will be assumed to be
as small as needed, we wonder if there is any relation between $M^t$
and $M^{t+\varepsilon}$. It turns out, as Morse \cite{mor1934} showed
we have that if $f$ does not have any critical point in the interval 
$(t,t+\varepsilon)$ then
 $M^t$ and $M^{t+\varepsilon}$ are difeomorphic. The proof is
 in fact quite elementary.
 
 A more subtle thing Morse proved is what happens when $M^t$
 crosses over a critical point. In this cased he showed that,
 if choose $\varepsilon$ so that $Crit(f)\cap (t,t+\varepsilon)$
 has exactly one point (which we can always do by hypothesis)
 then
  $M^{t+\varepsilon}$ can be obtained by adjoining a $k$-cell to $M^t$
 where $k$ happens to be the index of the unique critical point in 
$(t,t+\varepsilon)$.


In summary

\begin{theorem}
\cite{mor1934}
Let $\varepsilon>0$ so that
$$Crit(f)\cap (t,t+\varepsilon)=\emptyset$$

Then   $M^{t}$ and $M^{t+\varepsilon}$ 
are difeomorphic.


\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\cite{mor1934}
Let $\varepsilon>0$ so that
$$Crit(f)\cap (t,t+\varepsilon)=\{x_0\}$$

Let $k$ be the index of $x_0$. Then

Then  $M^{t+\varepsilon}$ 
is homotopy equivalent to $M^t\cup_\phi (D^{n-k}\times D^k)$ where
$D^k$ is the $k$-disk and $\phi$ is and adjunction map
between $\partial (D^{n-k}\times D^k)$ and $\partial M^t$.


\end{theorem}


\begin{corollary}
\cite{sma1961}
Any compact manifold 
of dimension $n$
is homotopy equivalent to a space such as the following:

$$
D^n\cup
D^{n-k_1}\times D^{k_1}
\cup
\cdots
\cup
D^{n-k_m}\times D^{k_m}
$$
\end{corollary}


\begin{theorem}[Morse inequalities]
Let $M$ be a compact manifold, and $b_i$ it's betti numbers.
Let $f$ be a Morse function on $M$. And let $\lambda_k$ be the 
number of $k$-index critical points of $f$. Then we have that:

$$
\lambda_i\geq b_i,\quad
\forall i\in\mathbb{N}
$$

\end{theorem}

\section{An application of Morse theory}

In this section we describe how to use Morse theory to classify closed $1$-manifolds.
In particular, we show the well-know theorem:

\begin{theorem}
A closed connected $1$-manifold is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^1$.
\end{theorem}

We briefly mention that it can be used to derive the usual classification of $2$-manifolds.





\section{The Morse-Smale complex}

Morse functions give a natural complex which computes the homology
of the manifold.

Let $R$ be a ring, then we define the chain groups 
to be:

$$
C_f(f)
\defequal
\left\{
\sum
_
{c\in Crit_k(f)}
a c
\vert
a\in R
\right\}
$$

And we define the differential operator $\partial$ to be:

$$
\partial a
=
\sum
_{b\in Crit_k(f)}
n(a,b)b
$$

Where $n(a,b)$ is the number of trajectories flowing from $a$
to $b$ through the gradient flow. This number is finite, and
we have that $\partial^2$.
